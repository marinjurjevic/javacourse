Message digest is a fixed-size binary digest which is calculated from arbitrary long data. The idea is simple.
You have some original data (lets denote it D); this can be a file on disk. Then you calculate a digest for this
data (lets denote it S); for example, if S is calculated with SHA-256 algorithm, the digest will always be
256-bits long, no matter how long is the original file you digested. Generally speaking, the original data can
not be reconstructed from the digest and this is not what the digests are used for. Digests are used to verify if
the data you have received (for example, when downloading the data from the Internet) arrived unchanged.
You will verify this by calculating the digest on the file you have downloaded and then you will compare the
calculated digest with the digest which is published on the web site from which you have started the
download. If something has changed during the download, there is extremely high probability that the
calculated digest will be different from the one published on the web site. You can see this on many of webpages
which offer file download. Visit, for example, Open Office down
